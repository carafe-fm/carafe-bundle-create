# Carafe Bundle Template

This is a template for carafe bundles. During development you can use the built-in live server to test for changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When you are ready to publish your bundle, call the following command, which will generate a `bundle.json` in the `dist`
folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
